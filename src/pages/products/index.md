heading: We don't just talk about our product, we use it!
description: >-
  We use our product for our self. Both so we can be sure that it is streamlined, works well and it does what it should be doing.
  We are a strong believer that data-driven decision making is the right way, so for us not to use it would be a bit hypocritical.

        You have lots of data. You probably don't have time creating or analyzing reports. And the reports are probably don't reflect  the "what". What to change, what to increase/decrease. We find the "what" so you can do the "do".
