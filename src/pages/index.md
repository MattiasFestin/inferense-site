  title: Why Inferense?
  description: >
    You can process all your data sources. Then you select the metrics you want to maximize or minimize. We will process them and find correlations and present the underlying processes that you can find and optimize, even in real-time!

  Inferense is an online application for collecting, automatically analyzing and reacting your data. You have lots of data. You probably don't have time creating or analyzing reports.
  It can be hard to find what is valuable. Our tools will find statistically significant links in your data.
  Then by creating flows or machine learning models, you create optimization tasks. Either by getting feedback via IM or executing a real action.

        You have lots of data. You probably don't have time creating or analyzing reports. And the reports are probably don't reflect  the "what". What to change, what to increase/decrease. We find the "what" so you can do the "do".

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
